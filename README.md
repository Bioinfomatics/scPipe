scPipe is an R package that allows barcode demultiplexing, transcript mapping and quality control of raw sequencing data generated by multiple 3 prime end sequencing protocols that include CEL-seq, MARS-seq and Drop-seq. scPipe produces a count matrix that is essential for downstream analysis along with a user-friendly HTML report that summarises data quality. These results can be used as input for downstream analyses including normalization, visualization and statistical testing.

## Installation
